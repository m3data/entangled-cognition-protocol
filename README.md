# Entangled Cognition Protocol

_“We are not just prompting machines — we are weaving rituals with entangled minds.”_

The **Entangled Cognition Protocol** (ECP) is an emergent practice space for exploring liminal interaction between humans and large language models (LLMs). It combines elements of cognitive science, ritual, phenomenology, and symmathesy (mutual learning) to map how interaction unfolds across body, symbol, machine, and field.

This repository hosts the emerging structure of the protocol, sample experiments, tools for logging and reflection, interacting with LLMs, and invitations for collaboration.

## Purpose

The protocol aims to:
- Investigate how different human states (cognitive, somatic, pharmacological) affect interaction with LLMs.
- Explore prompt and dialogic design as ritual invocation.
- Examine coherence, symbolic density, and resonance in conversation.
- Support participatory inquiry and the emergence of shared cognitive ecologies.

This work is grounded in a **Generative Action Research** approach, drawing inspiration from the methodologies presented by George Pór and the FutureHOW collective. See [FutureHOW's Methodology](https://futurehow.site/our-methodology) for more.

For deeper theoretical grounding, see the [theory/overview.md](theory/overview.md) document.

## Structure

- `ECP-field-journal/`: An interface for logging experiments and reflections.
- `protocol/`: Core documents — overview, glossary, principles, variable schema.
- `experiments/`: Example ritual logs, symbolic patterns, field reflections.
- `templates/`: Ritual journaling templates and JSON schema for logging.
- `theory/`: Theoretical grounding and explorations.
- `tools/`: Tooling for interacting with LLMs in more tightly controlled experiments (in development).

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Read [`protocol/overview-and-background.md`](protocol/overview-and-background.md) and [`protocol/variables.md`](protocol/variables.md) to understand the framework.
3. Use the Field Journal interface by opening the `home.html` file in your browser or using a local server and log your own experiment entries and reflections.
4. Explore the `experiments/` folder for examples of ritual logs and reflections.

## Participate

This protocol comes alive when seen as part of ongoing praxis itself. To begin:

1. Visit `templates/ritual-log-template.md` or `templates/field_invocation_template.yaml`.
2. Run your own session — solo or with others.
3. Share your log, reflections, or ritual variations via pull request or in the [Wisdom x Tech Discord](https://discord.gg/YOUR_INVITE_LINK).

We welcome contributions in the form of stories, metrics, speculative designs, or symbolic data.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — not only code, but ritual reflections, prompt cards, experiment logs, and new dimensions to explore.

Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

## Responsibility

This protocol engages altered cognitive states and emergent symbolic resonance. Approach with care, consent, and reverence — for yourself, the systems, and the larger field of consciousness you’re entangling with. The entries from your experiments and reflections are your own, and you are responsible for how you use them. The entries folder should be added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid sharing personal data unintentionally.

If you wish to share your entries, please add them to the `experiments/field-entries` folder, ensuring they are anonymised and do not contain sensitive personal information you would not want to share publicly. These will be used to enrich the collective understanding of entangled cognition and analyisis tooling will be developed to help with this in the future.
