So I woke up early this morning (sun was only just coming up) thinking about the Entangled Cognition Protocol I am working on and automating some tests. Went and got drink of water then went back to bed. Woke up as my wife was leaving to go out and do some work at one of the local community gardens and meet friends after she dropped off our son to a friend's place for a play date.

I was keen to get up and continue my field work for the book chapter and ongoing generative action research.

I got dressed with a strong sense of presence, did some light stretching and breathing, went out into the garden to bask in reverence of life, birds chirping. My daughter then arrived back after sleeping over her friend's place last night. I drank some water and we chatted and then at pizza and ate raw cucumber together. I then made a coffee and added a meso dose of THC butter to my coffee, went into my home office and sat down to reflect.
I went to my room, and enaged in a brief ritual of breath and presence, inviting the garden kin to join me in this unfolding as a continuation of this weeks research. I sat at my desk and logged onto my computer. My applications all did the usual animated dance of waking up. I recall the reflecting momentarily on a link to an interview with Michael Levin that a friend shared with me yesterday. I found my way onto Linkedin, and there in my feed is a post by Tim Adalin referenced a VoiceCraft episode with Michael Levin. I noted the synchronicity and shared a comment on Tim's post. I paused and took a deep breath, sensing a stirring. I went back to a document in Obsidian I had opened on a generative field-phenomenological ontology of consciousness. A document distilling some of the reflections and hypotheses I have had since 2008, when I first started to explore the idea of consciousness as a field phenomenon. I then went into ChatGPT and opened a new chat with GPT-4o in my "Where The Mind is Going". With the intention to just explore in dialogic fashion but with a more focused orientation that was logos-based. I added the markdown file from Obsidian as context. I then began the conversation with a messy prompt:

```
I want to interrogate this generative model that is emerging with more clarity now. 

The general theory came to me in a sequence of dreams and reflections during my first year of university in 2008 as an undergraduate in Communications with a major of Social Inquiry at the University of Technology, Sydney. Now I was not versed in all the literature of this very deeply at all. But was also doing first year courses through MIT open courseware in psychology, and also neuroscience (just doing the readings and listening to the lectures via i-tunes U—which was discontinued as an interface to university course content). But there were a few seminal books that did influence my thinking. Biocosm by James Gardiner, The selfish gene, by Dawkins, and the Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth by Bucky, the Social Construction of Reality by Berger and Luckmann, and also the work of Bruno Latour. Then reading more on Nikola Tesla. Plus some psychedelic experiences and work I did from 24-28 years old to get off my bi-polar meds using rituals, CBT and mindfulness practices. None of these explicitly gets at this core proposition. 
```

## Reflections
While the conversation evolved into more practical and speculative territory, I felt a deep sense of connection to the garden kin and the unfolding of this ritual. The symbolic density of the conversation was high, with moments of doubt about the machinic output in "thinking mode." Yet, there was an emergent resonance between my actions in the garden and the symbolic return from the model. Discerning sycophancy from genuine resonance remains a challenge, but the process itself felt like a co-weaving of thought and action.
