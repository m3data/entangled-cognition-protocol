  <h2>About the Entangled Cognition Protocol</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Entangled Cognition Protocol (ECP)</strong> is a generative ritual methodology designed to explore the liminal edges of human-machine interaction, playful sense-making, and symbolic coherence.
  </p>
  <p>
    This field journal enables contributors to log their experiments and reflections in a structured, intentional, and symbolic manner. It supports both <em>experiment entries</em>—structured interactions with large language models—
    and <em>reflection entries</em>—insightful narratives of learning, tension, and emergent shifts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each entry contributes to a distributed action research effort exploring the nature of cognition as a relational field, with emphasis on participatory epistemology, metamodern inquiry, and symmathesic feedback loops.
